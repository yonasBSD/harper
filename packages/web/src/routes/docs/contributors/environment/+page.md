title: Set Up Your Environment
---

To use the tooling required to build and debug Harper, you'll need the following programs available in your `$PATH`. 
For Nix users, we provide a [Nix development shell](#Nix-development-shell) to setup all the necessary tooling automatically.

- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)
- `bash`
- [`cargo`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (we develop against the latest version of Rust)
- `pnpm`
- `node`
- `grep`
- [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
- `zip`
- `pandoc`

To run integration tests, you may also need `libnss3` and/or `libasound3`.
These are installable in Ubuntu using `apt-get`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libnss3
sudo apt-get install libasound2
```

We develop a set of tools, accessible via `just`, to build and debug Harper's algorithm (otherwise known as `harper-core`) and its various integrations.
The source code is in the `justfile` [at the root of the repository](https://github.com/Automattic/harper/blob/master/justfile).
To see all the tools in the toolbox, run:

```bash
just --list
```

> Please note that `just build-web` _only_ builds the website for production, while `just dev-web` also spins up a development server.

Before making any modifications, we highly recommend that you run `just setup` to populate your build caches and download all dependencies.
If you see a Visual Studio code window pop open, don't worry! That's just a part of our integration tests.

## Nix development shell

If you use [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv), the shell will be loaded automatically when you change into the project directory.

Otherwise, run:

```bash
nix develop
```

This will start a bash shell that provides the build environment with everything you need to start contributing!
