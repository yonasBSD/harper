title: Neovim
---

Our Neovim integration is powered by [`harper-ls`](./language-server).

## Required Setup

Make sure you have `harper-ls` installed and available on your global or Neovim's `PATH`. You can do this using [`mason.nvim`](https://mason-registry.dev/registry/list?search=harper-ls) or via any of our other [supported installation methods](./language-server#Installation).

Though Neovim supports language servers [out-of-the-box](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html), for ease of use, we suggest using `harper-ls` through [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).

Once you have `harper-ls` and nvim-lspconfig installed, you need to add this to your `init.lua`:

```lua title=init.lua
require('lspconfig').harper_ls.setup {}
```

## Optional Configuration

Additionally, you can also configure things like which linters to use or how you want code actions to appear. Below is an example config where everything is set to their default values:

```lua title=init.lua
require('lspconfig').harper_ls.setup {
  settings = {
    ["harper-ls"] = {
      userDictPath = "",
      workspaceDictPath = "",
      fileDictPath = "",
      linters = {
        SpellCheck = true,
        SpelledNumbers = false,
        AnA = true,
        SentenceCapitalization = true,
        UnclosedQuotes = true,
        WrongApostrophe = false,
        LongSentences = true,
        RepeatedWords = true,
        Spaces = true,
        CorrectNumberSuffix = true
      },
      codeActions = {
        ForceStable = false
      },
      markdown = {
        IgnoreLinkTitle = false
      },
      diagnosticSeverity = "hint",
      isolateEnglish = false,
      dialect = "American",
      maxFileLength = 120000,
      ignoredLintsPath = "",
      excludePatterns = {}
    }
  }
}
```

For more information on what each of these configs do, you can head over to the [configuration section](./language-server#Configuration) of our `harper-ls` documentation.

## Common Config Changes

Programmers often find certain rules have too much of a hair-trigger.
The below config is a simple cut-and-paste that gives you much fewer false-positives.

```lua title=init.lua
require('lspconfig').harper_ls.setup {
  settings = {
    ["harper-ls"] = {
      linters = {
        SentenceCapitalization = false,
        SpellCheck = false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Native Neovim LSP Config

Neovim supports language servers [natively](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html), and therefore, Neovim supports Harper natively. To set up, first make sure that `harper-ls` is available on your system path. Next, add the following lines to your `init.lua` file:

```lua
-- General LSP setup
vim.lsp.config['*'] = {
    capabilities = { textDocument = { semanticTokens = { multilineTokenSupport = true } } },
    root_markers = { '.git' },
}
vim.diagnostic.config({ virtual_lines = true })

-- Harper specific setup
vim.lsp.config['harper'] = {
    cmd = { 'harper-ls', '--stdio' },
    filetypes = { 'markdown', 'text', 'tex', 'typst' }
}
vim.lsp.enable('harper')
```

And that is it! Run `:help gra` in Neovim for more information on code action support.
